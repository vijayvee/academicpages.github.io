* In this work, we develop a novel recurrent unit called the hGRU that complements feedforward neural networks with horizontal spatial connections.
* We demonstrate how just a `single-layer-deep hGRU` is more efficient in learning the below tasks of 'Contour detection'(a) and 'Pathfinder Challenge'[(b) & (c)] relative to its several previously proposed counterparts with orders of magnitude more parameters.
* We also show the compliance of our model's predictions with human behavioral data on a classic contour detection task.
* Please read more in detail about this work in our preprint on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08315.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08315.pdf).
