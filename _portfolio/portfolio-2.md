* I developed a sequence-to-sequence deep neural network using a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks for the task of video captioning.
* I have opensourced my TensorFlow implementation of this project on my GitHub profile in this repository: [Code link](https://github.com/vijayvee/video-captioning)
* A demo video of my system can be found on YouTube here: [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmLzgFdI7Xg).
