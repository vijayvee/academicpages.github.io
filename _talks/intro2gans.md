In this talk that I delivered at Artifacia Pvt. Ltd., I gave an introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks and their applications to several cutting-edge computer vision problems.

The content also comprises of a few useful hacks that the community, and I personally, have found useful while training this family of models.

Slides from this talk can be downloaded [`here`](https://www.slideshare.net/Artifacia/generative-adversarial-networks-and-their-applications)

I have opensourced the codebase to a couple of my projects where I have used GANs, the links to these projects are as follows:

* Adversarial text-to-image synthesis - [`code`](https://github.com/vijayvee/text-to-image-synthesis)
* Image Inpainting - [`code`](https://github.com/vijayvee/image-inpainting)
