Abstract available soon.

In this poster, we discuss the identification of early behavioral deficits in the SOD1-G85R mouse model for ALS. We also briefly discuss our automated behavioral monitoring system and its application to efficiently recording and analyzing activities of mice on a massively parallel scale.
