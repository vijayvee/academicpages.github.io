Welcome to my website!

I am Vijay Veerabadran, I am a Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am advised by Dr. Virginia de Sa and am part of the [Natural Computation Lab](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/).

My research interest lies in understanding the ability of the human brain in learning supervised tasks from very little data ([unlike state-of-the-art machine learning systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf)).

Equally as much, I am interested in understanding its robustness to unstructured stimuli (again, [unlike state-of-the-art machine learning systems](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/want-to-fool-a-computer-vision-system-just-tweak-some-colors/)). I aim to build models that possess these properties to pave way for robust and data-efficient computer vision systems. This leads to the following streams of research I look forward to pursuing:

* ### Modeling components of the primate visual cortex:
Following some of my recent work in this domain, I am keen to explore the use of Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks to functionally model components of the primate visual cortex. I believe that studying the gap between human and computer vision systems and modeling components that are missing in the latter will help fulfill my above interests of robust and data efficient computer vision systems.

* ### Deep learning techniques applied to neurology research:
Aside from biologically inspired computer vision, I wish to employ my expertise in deep learning to cut-down on significant (and fatiguing) manual work involved in neurology research in the diagnosis of medical conditions. My prior work in this domain involves automating the diagnosis of autistic development and neuro-motor disorders (ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia) by harnessing Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
