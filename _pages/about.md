Welcome to my website!

I am Vijay Veerabadran, I am a Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am advised by Dr. Virginia de Sa and am part of the [Natural Computation Lab](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/). My broad interest lies in developing neurally inspired learning algorithms. Following are two problems that are particularly interesting to me.

* ### Data-efficient learning:
    The *human brain* is immensely good at *generalizing* from one, or a few examples. I am keen to understand this ability of the brain, especially in recognizing objects from very *little* number of samples. This problem is formally referred to as 'Few-shot learning' and modeling it using neural networks forms my research interest.

* ### Lightness constancy:
    Equally as interesting is the *primate visual cortex* that is excellent at correcting for various *lighting distortions* present in the retinal image. Sources of these distortions include low-lighting conditions, outdoor lighting, flickering light sources etc. Understanding this *robustness* of the visual cortex, and modeling it using neural networks also forms my research interest. 

To sum up my ambitious goal, I wish to develop vision systems that can *learn to see* in a novel environment in the *wild*, in *very little* time!

Please check out the other sections of my website to know more about my professional experience so far. Thanks for stopping by, and I would be glad to hear from you! :) - Vijay
