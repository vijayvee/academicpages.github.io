Welcome to my website!

I am Vijay Veerabadran, I am a Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am advised by Dr. Virginia de Sa and am part of the [Natural Computation Lab](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/).

My research interest lies in understanding the ability of the human brain in learning supervised tasks from very little data ([unlike state-of-the-art machine learning systems](https://hackernoon.com/%EF%B8%8F-big-challenge-in-deep-learning-training-data-31a88b97b282)).

Equally as much, I am interested in understanding its robustness to unstructured stimuli (again, [unlike state-of-the-art machine learning systems](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/want-to-fool-a-computer-vision-system-just-tweak-some-colors/)). I aim to build models that possess these properties to pave way for robust and data-efficient computer vision systems. Aligned to this goal, I look forward to pursuing the following streams of research:

* ### Modeling components of the primate visual cortex:
Following some of my recent work in this domain, I am keen to explore the use of Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks to functionally model components of the primate visual cortex. I believe that studying the gap between human and computer vision systems and modeling components that are missing in the latter will help fulfill my above interests of robust and data efficient computer vision systems.

* ### Deep learning techniques applied to neurology research:
Also following my recent work in automating diagnosis of neuromotor diseases, I wish to employ my expertise in deep learning to cut-down on significant (and fatiguing) manual work involved in this direction of neurology research. I see this domain of my research benefiting from data-efficient computer vision, given the difficulty in obtaining large amounts of such sensitive data.

Please check out the other sections of my website to know more about my professional experience so far. Thanks for stopping by, and I would be glad to hear from you! :) - Vijay
