Welcome to my website!

I am Vijay Veerabadran, I am currently a Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science at the [Natural Computation Lab](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/) at the University of California, San Diego.

My research interests span the areas of Computer Vision, Computational Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in the following three streams of research:

* ### Developing biologically plausible models for low-level vision:
Following some of my recent work in this domain, I am keen to explore the use of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks to model biologically plausible algorithms for low-level computer vision tasks, i.e, tasks that do not require top-down and semantic influences. Some problems of my interest in this area are contour integration and figure ground organization.

* ### Deep learning techniques applied to neurology research:
I am interested in employing my expertise in deep learning to automate significant amounts of manual work involved in neurology research, in the diagnosis of medical conditions. My prior work in this domain involves automating the diagnosis of Autistic development and neuro-motor disorders (ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia) by harnessing Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

* ### Data efficient deep learning for computer vision:
Coming from a strong background of computer vision and machine learning, I am always interested in exploring problems at the intersection of these domains. I am particularly interested in developing data-efficient deep learning models for tasks in computer vision. I look forward to exploring the direction of few shot learning during my graduate research.
